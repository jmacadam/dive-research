- **Wet Season (December – March)**: Higher humidity, frequent rain, possible cyclones (especially January – February)
- **Transition Months (April – May)**: Some rain but improving visibility, good marine life activity

### **High vs. Low Season**
- **High Season (June – November)**: Best conditions, excellent visibility, peak marine life, but higher prices and more divers
