## TLDR: May ideal (summer in general), avoid December - February

## Orientation
If you want luxury and nightlife, **Seminyak and Uluwatu** are great choices. If you're into diving, **Amed, Tulamben, and Nusa Penida** are ideal. For culture and nature, **Ubud and Munduk** provide a more immersive experience. If you seek seclusion, **Lovina, Pemuteran, and West Bali National Park** offer tranquil alternatives.

**Dive Safaris**
A popular term in Bali is “dive safari”, which means you stay in at least 2 different hotels in different regions to experience the best scuba diving in Bali. In our experience, your trip to Bali should involve at least 3 hotels – one in the **Pemuteran** area, one in the **Amed** area, and one in South Bali (such as **Sanur, Ubud, or Seminyak**). 

If you are staying in South Bali to dive Nusa Penida, we recommend you stay in Sanur as that's where the dive shops are located. If you are staying in the south for just a night or two before your departure flights and want to see some sights and experience the local culture, Ubud is the place to be. Seminyak has many high-end accommodations but the traffic around Seminyak and Canggu is extremely congested. Aquamarine is one of the major tour operators with plenty of Bali dive safari options to choose from

  * _Be sure to try Warung Enak if you haven't already, one of my favs. The pumpkin cheesecake is wicked_

## **Where to Stay**

- **Marriott & Hyatt Hotels**: The St. Regis Bali (Nusa Dua) offers luxury beachfront stays, while Hyatt Regency Bali (Sanur) provides easy access to dive operators and calm waters.
- **Dive Resorts**: Liberty Dive Resort (Tulamben) and Villa Markisa (Tulamben) are excellent choices for divers wanting direct access to Bali’s best shore dive sites.
  * **Tulamben**
    * _If solely focused on diving (and particularly macro) then Tulamben may be best. There isn't much to do in Tulamben other than dive, relax, and edit photos. There are only a few places to eat and nothing to do after dark._
    * Bali Dive Resort ([sb](https://scubaboard.com/community/threads/bali-dive-resort-in-tulamben-bali-indonesia.646555/)) - I did 21 dives in Tulamben and two in Amed. All dives were either from a rocky shore or a jukung (Balinese boat). Tulamben is mainly for macro and muck photography, but there are a number of 'wide angle' sites with nice corals.
    * Villa Markisa Dive Resort - referenced in post above
    * _I can recommend Wonder Dive or Scuba Tulamben_
  * **Amed**
    * _a mix of macro, shore, a wreck or two, some drift, fringing reefs, then maybe Amed is better.  turtles, they are much more common (Green and Hawksbill) in Amed. Amed also has other things to do besides diving like a couple gyms, yoga studios, massage and spas, a nice beach club (more like cliff club but spectacular views), deep sea fishing, and a plethora of restos and cafes to enjoy during a stay._
    * _I suggest staying in the west side of Amed, to be closer to Tulamben for dives in that area._
    * _Agree, it one wants to split their diving between Amed and Tulamben, I wouldn't stay past Jemeluk Bay...Bunaten and Lipah are a ways down the road. Anywhere between Jemeluk Bay and Jalan Malasti is prime._
    * Puri Wirata Dive Resort and Spa - referenced in post above
- **Boutique & Unique**: Bambu Indah (Ubud) offers an eco-luxury bamboo experience, and The Slow (Canggu) is a modern artistic retreat with a vibrant social scene.

## **Attractions & Activities**

- **Snorkeling**: Menjangan Island has pristine coral walls, Blue Lagoon offers easy access for beginners, and Amed has some of Bali’s best house reefs.
- **Hiking**: Mount Batur sunrise trek is a popular choice for stunning panoramic views, while Sekumpul Waterfall is a lush, off-the-beaten-path adventure.
- **Cultural Sites**: Uluwatu Temple sits on a dramatic cliff edge with traditional Kecak fire dance performances at sunset, while Tirta Empul Water Temple is a sacred place for ritual purification.
- **Adventure**: White water rafting on the Ayung River provides an exhilarating ride through the jungle, and ATV tours in Ubud allow you to explore rice terraces and local villages up close.


## **Top Dive Sites in Bali & Best Seasons**
Nusa Penida is one of Bali's diving hotspots, where divers flock to dive with manta rays and search for mola molas. Another renowned region for diving in Bali is the Northeast coast, which is famous for macro sites and the USAT Liberty shipwreck, but also boasts some great reef diving. The quiet Northwest is home to spectacular plunging coral walls and some fascinating macro sites - perfect for divers seeking exceptional diving away from the crowds.

### **1. Tulamben (USAT Liberty Shipwreck)**
- **Why Go**: World-famous shore dive featuring a WWII wreck teeming with marine life, including barracuda, bumphead parrotfish, and macro critters.
- **Depth Range**: 5-30m
- **Best Season**: **May to November** (dry season offers best visibility, but diveable year-round)
- **Snips**:
  * _Tulamben and Pemuteran get less rain than other places in Bali and the visibility at Menjangan Island is typically unaffected during rainy season._
  * _Tulamben is on the north coast of Bali, and is quite different of a destination. The water is warm and calm all year round. There are amazing muck diving sites, full of fantastic macro critters, especially nudibranchs of all shapes and sizes. There is the famous USS Liberty wreck dive, one of the most famous dives in the world. And there are great wall dives with huge sea fans, and beautiful reefs. Not the best place for really large stuff, other than some hawksbill turtles, and the bumphead parrotfish on the Liberty...but still fun for wide angle shooting._

### **2. Nusa Penida (Manta Point & Crystal Bay)**
- **Why Go**: Manta rays at Manta Point year-round; Mola Mola (oceanic sunfish) sightings at Crystal Bay from August to October.
- **Depth Range**: 10-30m
- **Best Season**: **April-May for mantas; August-October for Mola Mola**
- **Snips:**
  * _Nusa Penida is a small island off the Southeast corner of Bali, with reliably great manta encounters at Manta Point, and molas at Crystal Bay from June to October. We were there in April, which meant no mola encounters, but the water was very warm (comfy in a 3mm wetsuit), we had fantastic manta encounters, lots of turtles and octopus, and we had some phenomenal drift dives along pristine reefs._

### **3. Menjangan Island**
- **Why Go**: Less crowded, pristine coral walls, and some of the best visibility in Bali.
- **Depth Range**: 5-30m
- **Best Season**: **April to November** (calmest seas and best visibility)
- **Snips**:
  * _...the visibility at Menjangan Island is typically unaffected during rainy season._
  * _Menjangan Island is my favourite place to dive in Bali because of its spectacular coral walls and the dive sites are practically void of divers compared to other areas. The best dive sites at Menjangan are Eel Garden, Underwater Cave, POS 2, and Bat Cave and you can see sharks, electric clams, pygmy squid, seahorses, and tons of nudibranchs and fish._

### **4. Amed**
- **Why Go**: Macro life, coral reefs, and relaxed diving; great for beginner and experienced divers alike.
- **Depth Range**: 5-30m
- **Best Season**: **April to November** (minimal rain and good visibility)

### **5. Blue Lagoon (Padang Bai)**
- **Why Go**: Great variety of marine life, including reef sharks, turtles, and occasional macro critters.
- **Depth Range**: 5-25m
- **Best Season**: **May to November** (best conditions, but accessible year-round)

### **6. Secret Bay**
- **Why Go**: A world-class muck diving site for macro lovers, featuring rare critters like frogfish and ghost pipefish.
- **Depth Range**: 3-12m
- **Best Season**: **May to October** (best visibility and reduced runoff from rainfall)

### **7. Candidasa (Gili Tepekong, Gili Mimpang)**
- **Why Go**: Strong currents bring pelagic species like reef sharks and occasional Mola Mola.
- **Depth Range**: 10-40m
- **Best Season**: **August to October** (Mola Mola sightings and calmer conditions)

## **Diving Seasonality & Safety Considerations**

### **Currents & Safety**
- **Strongest Currents**: July to October (**best for drift diving but requires experience**)
