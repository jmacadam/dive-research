Prompt: Create a detailed diving guide for the Great Barrier Reef, formatted similarly to the "Maldives Diving Seasonality & Conditions" and "Raja Ampat Diving Guide" and "Bali Diving Guide" documents. The purpose is to provide a clear, structured overview of the regionâ€™s diving conditions, seasonality, and top dive sites. The document should include the following sections, but I will ask you to create them one at a time starting with 
Top Dive Sites & Best Seasons
After that we will continue in the following order:
Diving Seasonality & Safety Considerations. 
Highlights section for Specific Marine Life or other attractions
Diving Conditions by Month (Table)
then we can do all of these sections at once:
Where to Stay, Attractions & Activities, and Food & Dining
and lastly considering all context, provide the TLDR

Here is what each section should contain, but reference project files for existing examples:

TLDR Summary
A one-liner indicating the best month to dive and the least desirable month, eg "## TLDR: March ideal, avoid July"

Section: Where to Stay:
Provide a mix of accommodations, including major hotel chains (specifically Marriott and Hyatt if available), dive resorts, and unique boutique stays.
Highlight options with house reefs for easy snorkeling or shore diving.
Include considerations like proximity to dive sites, price range, and any relevant features (luxury, eco-friendly, etc.).

Section: Attractions & Activities:
Suggest non-diving activities such as snorkeling, hiking, cultural sites, and adventure tourism.
Provide details on location, seasonal timing, and what makes each attraction unique.

Section: Food & Dining:
List notable restaurants and food experiences in the region.
Prioritize vegetarian-friendly and seafood options.
Include location details, any seasonal considerations, and price range insights.

Section: Top Dive Sites & Best Seasons
List the most notable dive sites, describing:
Why Go: Unique highlights (e.g., specific marine life, reef formations, wrecks).
Depth Range: Minimum and maximum dive depths.
Best Season: The optimal time to dive there and any seasonality factors.

Section: Diving Seasonality & Safety Considerations
Currents & Safety: Identify the months with the strongest currents and their impact on diving (e.g., best for drift diving vs. easier conditions).
Sea Conditions: Explain when seas are calm vs. rough (important for boat dives and liveaboards).
Visibility: Outline the months with the best and worst visibility.
Water Temperature: Provide a breakdown of temperature ranges by season and recommendations for wetsuit thickness.
Weather & Rainfall: Describe the wet and dry seasons, including how they impact diving conditions.
High vs. Low Season using above info to capture the essence of all of the above info for each

Section: Highlights section for Specific Marine Life or other attractions
Highlight key species (e.g., whale sharks, hammerhead sharks, manta rays) or attractions (wrecks, etc) and the best months to see them.
Why those months are ideal (e.g., plankton blooms, migration patterns, dive conditions).
List best locations for each species.
Best via - how is best to dive this, i.e. by liveaboard, shore dive, boat (day trip) and any context for that

Section: Diving Conditions by Month (Table)
Include a structured table with (units: imperial and fahrenheit) summarizing:
Month
Air & Sea Temperature (F)
Diving Season (Dry/Wet/Transition)
Diving Highlights
Rainfall & Rainy Days
Other Notes (e.g., best for liveaboards, peak marine life activity)
[OPTIONAL] Additional Notes
Any region-specific diving considerations, local regulations, or special tips.
Existing Information

Here is any relevant information from previous notes or documents that should be incorporated into the new guide:

We previously dove with Mike Ball on Spirit of Freedom from Cairns and it was excellent.
