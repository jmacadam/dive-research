Prompt: Create a detailed diving guide for Fiji, formatted similarly to the "Maldives Diving Seasonality & Conditions" and "Raja Ampat Diving Guide" and "Bali Diving Guide" documents. The purpose is to provide a clear, structured overview of the region’s diving conditions, seasonality, and top dive sites. The document should include the following sections:

TLDR Summary
A one-liner indicating the best month to dive and the least desirable month, eg "## TLDR: March ideal, avoid July"

Section: Where to Stay:
Provide a mix of accommodations, including major hotel chains (specifically Marriott and Hyatt if available), dive resorts, and unique boutique stays.
Highlight options with house reefs for easy snorkeling or shore diving.
Include considerations like proximity to dive sites, price range, and any relevant features (luxury, eco-friendly, etc.).

Section: Attractions & Activities:
Suggest non-diving activities such as snorkeling, hiking, cultural sites, and adventure tourism.
Provide details on location, seasonal timing, and what makes each attraction unique.

Section: Food & Dining:
List notable restaurants and food experiences in the region.
Prioritize vegetarian-friendly and seafood options.
Include location details, any seasonal considerations, and price range insights.

Section: Top Dive Sites & Best Seasons
List the most notable dive sites, describing:
Why Go: Unique highlights (e.g., specific marine life, reef formations, wrecks).
Depth Range: Minimum and maximum dive depths.
Best Season: The optimal time to dive there and any seasonality factors.

Section: Diving Seasonality & Safety Considerations
Currents & Safety: Identify the months with the strongest currents and their impact on diving (e.g., best for drift diving vs. easier conditions).
Sea Conditions: Explain when seas are calm vs. rough (important for boat dives and liveaboards).
Visibility: Outline the months with the best and worst visibility.
Water Temperature: Provide a breakdown of temperature ranges by season and recommendations for wetsuit thickness.
Weather & Rainfall: Describe the wet and dry seasons, including how they impact diving conditions.
High vs. Low Season using above info to capture the essence of all of the above info for each

Section: Highlights section for Specific Marine Life or other attractions
Highlight key species (e.g., whale sharks, hammerhead sharks, manta rays) or attractions (wrecks, etc) and the best months to see them.
Why those months are ideal (e.g., plankton blooms, migration patterns, dive conditions).
List best locations for each species.
Best via - how is best to dive this, i.e. by liveaboard, shore dive, boat (day trip) and any context for that

Section: Diving Conditions by Month (Table)
Include a structured table summarizing:
Month
Air & Sea Temperature
Diving Season (Dry/Wet/Transition)
Diving Highlights
Rainfall & Rainy Days
Other Notes (e.g., best for liveaboards, peak marine life activity)
[OPTIONAL] Additional Notes
Any region-specific diving considerations, local regulations, or special tips.
Existing Information

Here is any relevant information from previous notes or documents that should be incorporated into the new guide:

Peak Seasons for Tourism and Diving
* TLDR: May
* Tourism Peak Season: June to September, when the weather is drier, cooler, and less humid. December to early January is also busy due to holiday travel.
* Diving Peak Season: July to October, offering the best visibility (25-40m), clear waters, and abundant marine life, including shark diving in Beqa Lagoon and manta rays in Kadavu and the Yasawa Islands.

Low Season and Less Recommended Times for Diving
* Tourism Low Season: November to April, the wet season, which brings higher humidity, increased rainfall, and occasional cyclones.
* Diving Low Season: January to March has reduced visibility due to increased rain runoff, though marine life remains active.

Top Diving Destinations
1. Great White Wall (Somosomo Strait, Taveuni) – Famous for its breathtaking soft coral walls.
2. Beqa Lagoon – Known for shark diving and diverse marine species.
3. Rainbow Reef (Taveuni) – Features stunning soft corals and excellent drift diving.
4. Namena Marine Reserve (Savusavu) – Pristine reefs, diverse marine ecosystems.
5. Bligh Water & Koro Sea – Ideal for advanced divers, featuring pelagic encounters and dramatic underwater landscapes.

Non-Diving Activities and Attractions
Fiji offers more than just diving. Here are some other highlights:
* Sabeto Hot Springs and Mud Pools – A fun and relaxing experience.
* Garden of the Sleeping Giant – A beautiful orchid garden near Nadi.
* Sigatoka Sand Dunes – A national park with stunning dune landscapes.
* Cloud 9 – A floating platform with a bar and pizzeria in the Mamanuca Islands.
* Levuka – A UNESCO World Heritage site with colonial history.


Monthly Climate and Diving Conditions in Fiji
Month	Avg. High	Avg. Sea	Season	Diving Highlights	Avg. Rainfall (inches)	Avg. Rainy Days	Avg. Sunshine Hours/Day	Other Notes
January	86	83	Low	Warm waters; potential for coral spawning; increased plankton attracts larger species	13.9	14	6.5	Peak of wet season; higher rainfall; risk of cyclones; reduced visibility due to runoff
February	87	84	Low	Similar to January; opportunities to see larger pelagics like manta rays	11.5	15	6.5	Continuation of wet season; highest chance of cyclones; warmest sea temperatures
March	86	84	Low	Warm waters; marine life active; end of coral spawning period	13.8	16	5.5	Wet season persists; rainfall begins to decrease towards month's end
April	84	83	Shoulder	Transition to drier conditions; improving visibility; diverse marine life	12.1	10	5.5	End of wet season; decreasing rainfall; pleasant diving conditions
May	82	82	Peak	Excellent visibility; vibrant coral reefs; reef fish congregations	8.4	5	6.5	Start of dry season; cooler temperatures; ideal for diving
June	80	80	Peak	Clear waters; increased shark sightings; ideal for underwater photography	6.3	4	6.0	Dry season; minimal rainfall; comfortable conditions
July	79	79	Peak	Best visibility; frequent shark encounters; healthy coral formations	5.2	3	5.5	Coolest month; dry season continues; optimal diving conditions
August	78	78	Peak	Similar to July; excellent for observing diverse marine species	5.6	4	5.5	Dry season; festivals and cultural events; popular travel period
September	79	78	Peak	Warm waters; abundant marine life; ideal for drift diving	6.8	5	5.0	End of dry season; stable weather; high underwater visibility
October	81	79	Shoulder	Transition to warmer waters; potential for coral spawning; active marine ecosystems	9.5	6	5.5	Beginning of wet season; increasing temperatures; occasional showers
November	83	81	Low	Warmer seas; opportunities to witness coral spawning; diverse marine life	9.4	9	6.0	Wet season onset; higher humidity; increased rainfall
December	85	82	Low	Warm waters; active marine life; chance to see juvenile reef species	13.2	12	6.5	Peak of wet season; festive season; higher tourist numbers
Key Takeaways
* Fiji is a year-round diving destination, but the dry season (May-October) provides the best visibility and conditions.
* The wet season (November-April) has warmer waters and active marine life but comes with higher rainfall, reduced visibility, and cyclone risks.
* Shark diving is excellent year-round, particularly in Beqa Lagoon.
* Manta rays are most commonly seen from May to October.
* For optimal conditions with fewer crowds, consider April, May, or October.
By planning according to these insights, divers can maximize their experience while enjoying Fiji’s natural beauty and marine life.
