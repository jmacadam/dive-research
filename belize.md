For **first-time visitors**, a **stay on Ambergris Caye or Caye Caulker** offers the best mix of convenience, good diving, and island life. **Serious divers** should consider **Turneffe Atoll resorts or a liveaboard** for the most diverse and exciting underwater experiences. If **whale sharks or remote reefs** are a priority, **Placencia and Southern Belize** are the best choices.

### **Choosing Between Resort-Based & Liveaboard Diving**
- **Resort-Based Diving:** Ideal for those who want easy access to day dives and a mix of land-based activities, including Mayan ruins and jungle adventures.

- **Best Overall Months:** **April – June & November – January** (great visibility, marine life, and stable conditions)
- **Avoid:** **July – October** (hurricane season can bring rough seas and reduced visibility, though diving is still possible)

## **Diving Seasonality & Safety Considerations in Belize**

### **Best Diving Seasons & Conditions**
Belize offers **year-round diving**, but the best conditions vary by season:
- **Peak Diving Season:** **November – May** (dry season, calm seas, best visibility)
- **Best Overall Months:** **April – June & November – January** (optimal marine life encounters, clear conditions)
- **Whale Shark Season:** **March – June** (best chances at Gladden Spit)
- **Avoid:** **July – October** (hurricane season can bring rough seas and reduced visibility, though diving remains possible)

### **Currents & Safety**
- **Stronger Currents:** March – June (**best for drift diving, attracts pelagic species**)
- **Weaker Currents:** July – October (**better for beginners, but lower visibility due to runoff**)
- **Full & New Moon Phases:** Stronger currents during tidal shifts (optimal for big fish activity but requires drift diving experience)

### **Sea Conditions**
- **Calmest Seas:** February – May (**ideal for liveaboards and offshore atolls**)
- **Rougher Seas:** September – October (**hurricane season can cause large swells and unpredictable weather**)
- **Moderate Conditions:** November – January (**mostly stable, but occasional winter cold fronts can bring stronger winds**)

### **Visibility**
- **Best (25-40m / 80-130ft clarity):** **November – May** (dry season ensures clear water, minimal runoff)
- **Moderate (15-25m / 50-80ft clarity):** **June – July** (increased plankton blooms, lower visibility but attracts whale sharks)
- **Lowest (10-20m / 30-65ft clarity):** **August – October** (rainfall and river runoff impact visibility, especially near the mainland)

### **Water Temperature & Wetsuit Recommendations**
- **November – April:** **26-28°C (79-82°F)** → 3mm full wetsuit recommended
- **May – October:** **27-30°C (80-86°F)** → 3mm shorty or full suit
- **Cooler Thermoclines (Rare):** In deep sites like the **Blue Hole**, temperatures can drop to **24°C (75°F)** at depth

### **Weather & Rainfall**
- **Dry Season (November – May):** 
  - Little to no rain, low humidity, and clear skies
  - Best time for stable diving conditions and long-range boat trips
- **Wet Season (June – October):** 
  - Higher humidity, frequent afternoon showers, increased runoff near coastal areas
  - Tropical storms and hurricanes possible (especially August – October)
  - Some sites, particularly near the mainland, can have reduced visibility due to sediment runoff

### **High vs. Low Season for Diving**
- **High Season (December – April):** 
  - Best visibility and weather conditions
  - Increased tourism, meaning higher prices and booked-out accommodations
  - Great for liveaboards and trips to Lighthouse Reef, Turneffe Atoll, and Blue Hole
- **Low Season (July – October):** 
  - Fewer tourists, lower prices, and more relaxed travel
  - Potentially rougher seas, lower visibility, and higher risk of weather-related cancellations
- **Shoulder Seasons (May – June & November):** 
  - Good mix of stable conditions and fewer crowds
  - Best time for diverse marine life encounters

### **Safety Considerations & Tips**
1. **Hurricane Awareness:** If traveling between August and October, monitor weather forecasts and consider travel insurance in case of cancellations.
2. **Marine Life Encounters:** While Belize has relatively safe waters, some sites (e.g., The Elbow) may have aggressive barracudas or sharks during feeding times—always follow dive guide instructions.
3. **Depth & Experience Levels:** The **Great Blue Hole** is best for advanced divers due to deep depths and limited bottom time. Beginners should stick to shallower barrier reef sites.
4. **Liveaboard Safety:** For those choosing liveaboards, seas can get choppy in October and November—bring seasickness medication if prone to motion sickness.
5. **Strong Currents:** Drift diving at Turneffe Atoll and The Elbow can be exhilarating but is best suited for experienced divers.

## **Highlights: Specific Marine Life & Special Attractions in Belize**

### **Whale Sharks**
- **Best Months:** **March – June** (peak activity during full moons)
- **Best Locations:** **Gladden Spit & Silk Cayes** (_very undoably_ far from Ambergris)
- **Why?** These gentle giants follow the snapper spawning aggregations in Belizean waters, making for some of the best whale shark diving experiences in the Caribbean.
- **Best Via:** **Boat dive (day trip)** from Placencia, licensed operators required
- **Snips:** 
  - _In case you are not aware of this, the whales are typically seen on a few days around certain full moons, and dive operators need to apply for the good time slots in a lottery as they limit the numbers. And unless they have eased up on the rules, the whales are more likely to appear late in the day, after the time dive boats are supposed to be out of their area (I think it was 5pm). And even if you were there at a good time, I don't know that you could count on the whales cooperating on the particular day you happened to be there. I really think you'd want to stay down there for a few days at least._

### **Caribbean Reef Sharks & Nurse Sharks**
- **Best Months:** **Year-round**, but most active **April – June**
- **Best Locations:** **Half Moon Caye Wall, The Elbow, Turneffe Atoll, Hol Chan Marine Reserve**

### **Eagle Rays & Manta Rays**
- **Best Months:** **January – April** (dry season offers best visibility)

- **Best Via:** **Liveaboard or resort-based diving** at Lighthouse Reef and Turneffe

### **Sea Turtles (Loggerhead, Green, Hawksbill)**
- **Best Months:** **May – September** (nesting and hatching season)
- **Best Locations:** **Hol Chan Marine Reserve, Silk Cayes, Ambergris Caye**
- **Why?** Belize is a crucial habitat for endangered turtles, offering frequent sightings of feeding individuals and hatchlings near protected areas.
- **Best Via:** **Shore dives, snorkel tours, or boat dives** from the cayes

### **Schooling Fish & Large Aggregations**
- **Best Months:** **March – June** (snapper spawning attracts predators)
- **Best Locations:** **The Elbow (Turneffe Atoll), Gladden Spit, Long Caye Wall**
- **Why?** Huge schools of jacks, snappers, and barracuda create intense bait-ball spectacles, often attracting sharks and other large predators.
- **Best Via:** **Drift diving from liveaboards or boat day trips**

- **Best Months:** **Year-round**, but best from **July – October** (less diver traffic, easier sightings)
- **Best Locations:** **South Water Caye, Hol Chan Marine Reserve, Turneffe Flats**
- **Why?** Belize’s reefs and seagrass beds are full of fascinating macro life, including pipefish, blennies, and rare nudibranchs.
- **Best Via:** **Shallow reef dives or muck diving from land-based resorts**

### **Wreck Diving: The Sayonara Wreck**
- **Best Months:** **November – May** (best visibility)
